# HookHub - Project Specification

## Overview
HookHub is an open-source discovery platform for Claude Code hooks. It serves as a centralized repository where developers can browse, search, and discover community-created hooks to enhance their Claude Code workflows.

## What are Claude Code Hooks?
Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, SessionEnd). They provide deterministic control over Claude Code's behavior, enabling automated actions like code formatting, linting, notifications, and custom validations.

## Project Goals (MVP)
- **Primary Goal**: Create a simple, browsable catalog of open-source Claude Code hooks
- **User Value**: Help developers discover hooks to automate their workflows
- **Scope**: Display-only functionality (no upload, authentication, or user-generated content in MVP)

---

## Features (MVP)

### 1. Hook Discovery Grid
- **Main landing page** displays hooks in a responsive grid layout
- Each grid card shows:
  - Hook name
  - Category badge/tag
  - Brief description (truncated if needed)
  - Link to GitHub repository
  - Optional: Star count, last updated date

### 2. Search Functionality
- Simple search bar to filter hooks by:
  - Name
  - Description keywords
  - Category

### 3. Category Filtering
- Allow users to filter hooks by category
- Common categories might include:
  - Code Quality (formatting, linting)
  - Notifications
  - Testing
  - Git/Version Control
  - Security
  - Logging
  - Custom Validation
  - Other/Utilities

---

## Data Model

### Hook Object Structure
```json
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "name": "Hook Name",
  "description": "Clear description of what this hook does",
  "category": "Code Quality",
  "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/username/repo",
  "stars": 42,
  "lastUpdated": "2025-10-20T12:00:00Z",
  "tags": ["formatting", "python", "automation"],
  "author": "GitHub Username"
}
```

### Data Source
For MVP, hooks will be sourced from:
- Curated list stored in a JSON file or database
- GitHub repositories tagged with specific topics (e.g., `claude-code-hook`)
- Manual additions by maintainers

---

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (React)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive grid and components
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Key Components**:
  - `HookGrid`: Main grid container
  - `HookCard`: Individual hook display card
  - `SearchBar`: Search input component
  - `CategoryFilter`: Category selection component
  - `Header`: App header with branding
  - `Footer`: Links to contribute, docs, etc.

### Backend/Data (MVP)
- **Option 1**: Static JSON file served as API route
- **Option 2**: GitHub API integration to fetch repositories with specific topics
- **Option 3**: Simple database (e.g., Supabase, Firebase) with manually curated entries

### Hosting
- Vercel or Netlify for easy Next.js deployment
- GitHub Pages (if fully static)

---

## User Flow

1. **Landing Page**
   - User arrives at HookHub homepage
   - Sees grid of hook cards
   - Can immediately browse available hooks

2. **Search/Filter**
   - User types keywords into search bar
   - Grid updates in real-time to show matching hooks
   - User can select category filter
   - Grid narrows to show hooks in that category

3. **Hook Details**
   - User clicks "View Repository" or card
   - Opens GitHub repository in new tab
   - User can read full hook documentation and implementation

---

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Design Principles
- **Clean and Minimal**: Focus on readability and easy scanning
- **Fast Performance**: Optimize for quick load times
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Accessible**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Visual Style
- Modern, developer-focused aesthetic
- Use of subtle gradients or solid colors for category badges
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Adequate white space between grid items
- Hover states for interactivity feedback

### Grid Layout
- **Desktop**: 3-4 columns
- **Tablet**: 2 columns
- **Mobile**: 1 column
- Card height: Auto or fixed with overflow handling

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- User authentication and profiles
- Hook submission flow (community contributions)
- Rating/review system
- Usage statistics and analytics
- Hook configuration previews/code snippets
- Installation guides/copy-paste configs
- Collection/favorites feature
- Hook versioning
- Integration with Claude Code CLI for direct installation
- Automated GitHub discovery via webhook

---

## Success Metrics (MVP)
- Number of hooks displayed
- Search functionality works correctly
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Mobile responsive on common devices
- Zero critical accessibility issues

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should we display code snippets on the cards?
- [ ] Do we need a detailed view page, or just link to GitHub?
- [ ] How do we verify hook quality/safety?
- [ ] Should we include hook type (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.) as metadata?
- [ ] Do we want to show installation instructions inline?
